AI-driven repurposing copilots address key inefficiencies in traditional drug repurposing workflows, where major cost centers include extensive literature mining, manual hypothesis generation, pharmacovigilance data analysis, and preclinical validation—often consuming 1,000+ analyst hours per project at $200/hour rates. These workflows rely on cross-functional teams reviewing biomedical databases, clinical records, and patents, leading to 6-year average timelines and $300 million total costs per candidate versus $2-3 billion for de novo discovery. Analyst time dominates early stages, with pharma teams spending months on non-obvious drug-disease associations that AI can prioritize systematically.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]

## Quantitative ROI Model
Adopting an AI copilot yields ROI through 50-70% time reductions (3 years saved per project) and 85% cost savings by automating data integration and prediction. Assuming 1,000 hours saved per project at $200/hour, annual savings scale with project volume as shown below.[4][5][6][1]

| Company Size       | Annual Projects | Hours Saved per Project | Total Hours Saved/Year | Hourly Rate ($) | Annual Cost Savings ($M) |
|--------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|------------------------:|
| Small (2 analysts) |               5 |                     1000 |                    5000 |             200 |                      1.0 |
| Medium (5 analysts)|              15 |                     1000 |                   15000 |             200 |                      3.0 |
| Large (10 analysts)|              30 |                     1000 |                   30000 |             200 |                      6.0 | [1]

Payback occurs within 6-12 months for SaaS pricing under $1M/year, with NPV exceeding $10M over 5 years for mid-sized firms.[9][1]

## Sensitivity Analysis
ROI varies by company size and project scale: small firms (5 projects/year) see 3x ROI at base case but drop to 1.5x if hours saved fall to 500/project; medium firms (15 projects) maintain 5x ROI across ±20% variations; large firms (30+ projects) achieve 8-10x even at high-end $300/hour rates. Scaling to 50 projects amplifies savings to $10M/year for large pharmas, while oncology-focused pipelines (36% market share) double impact due to data richness.[10][1][4]

## Adoption Blockers
Enterprise barriers include legacy system integration with ERP/CTMS, regulatory uncertainty under EU AI Act/FDA guidelines classifying repurposing AI as high-risk, and trust gaps from opaque "black box" models. CIOs face 12-18 month PoC-to-scale delays due to compliance validation and data silos, plus talent shortages for AI governance. Mitigation requires GxP-validated APIs and pilot programs tied to EMA/FDA credibility frameworks.[11][12][13][14]

## Pricing Models
SaaS subscriptions ($500K-$5M/year) suit steady workflows with tiered compute access; per-candidate ($10K-50K) aligns with sporadic repurposing; per-project ($100K-500K + milestones) ties to validation success, as in AstraZeneca-BenevolentAI deals. Hybrid royalty (1-5% net sales) maximizes alignment for high-value oncology hits, preserving 65-75% margins.[15][9]

## Provenance Benefits
Transparent provenance—tracking data sources, model inferences, and audit trails—slashes regulatory friction by enabling FDA/EMA credibility assessments and HIPAA/SOX compliance, cutting validation costs 30-50%. EMA's 2025-2028 workplan mandates such traceability for high-risk AI, reducing submission timelines from 12 to 6 months and audit risks. This builds clinician trust, accelerates approvals, and unlocks repurposed drug revenues (25-40% of pharma sales).[13][16][4][10][11]

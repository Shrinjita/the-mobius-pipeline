# **Product Requirements Document (PRD): The Möbius Dashboard**
*Version 1.0 | For EY Techathon 6.0 Submission*

---

## **1. Objective**
To enable a Pharma R&D Strategist to transform a vague hypothesis into an **audited, investment-ready memo in under 10 minutes**, by automating evidence synthesis across molecular, clinical, and IP data sources while providing full traceability and regulatory-grade provenance.

## **2. User Stories**
1. **As an R&D Strategist**, I want to **input a molecule and target disease** to receive a unified, synthesized view of all relevant evidence, so I can quickly assess repurposing potential.
2. **As an R&D Strategist**, I want to **visually explore connections** between drugs, diseases, trials, and patents in an interactive graph, so I can discover non-obvious relationships.
3. **As an R&D Strategist**, I want to **click any claim** and immediately see its source (PMID, NCT, Patent#), snippet, and confidence score, so I can verify evidence credibility.
4. **As an R&D Strategist**, I want to **watch a live feed of AI agents** working on my query, so I can trust the process and understand how conclusions are reached.
5. **As an R&D Strategist**, I want to **generate and customize an investment memo** with one click, including executive summary, evidence tables, and risk assessment, so I can present findings to stakeholders.
6. **As an R&D Strategist**, I want to **export a fully audited report** with cryptographic hashes for each claim, so I can meet regulatory compliance requirements.

  - `[CLINICAL AGENT] Searching ClinicalTrials.gov... ✅ 23 trials found`
  - `[LITERATURE AGENT] Scanning PubMed via semantic search... ✅ 189 papers found`
  - `[BIOACTIVITY AGENT] Fetching assay data from ChEMBL... ✅ 42 assays found`
  - `[KG BUILDER] Synthesizing graph with 1,402 nodes...`
  - `[REPORT AGENT] Generating investment memo draft...`
- **Visual Indicators:** Agent icons that "light up" when active, progress bars for each agent type, estimated time remaining.
- **Pause/Resume Controls:** For demo purposes, allow pausing to explain each step.

### **c. Unified Evidence Graph**
- **Interactive Force-Directed Graph** powered by Neo4j/Cytoscape.js:
  - **Node Types & Colors:**
    - Molecule (Blue)
    - Disease (Red)
    - Gene/Pathway (Green)
    - Clinical Trial (Orange)
    - Patent (Purple)
    - Publication (Teal)
  - **Edge Properties:**
    - Type: `mechanism_of_action`, `clinical_trial`, `patent_claim`, `literature_association`
    - Strength: Line thickness (1-5px) based on confidence score
    - Recency: Line color gradient (dark = recent, light = older)
- **Graph Controls:**
  - Zoom/Pan
  - Node/Edge type toggles
  - Cluster by evidence type or disease area
  - Search within graph
- **Click Interaction:** Clicking a node/edge highlights connections and populates the Provenance Panel.

### **d. Provenance Panel**
- **Contextual Sidebar** that updates on graph selection:
  - **Claim ID:** `Mobius-C-2025-{hash}`
  - **Source:** 
    - Type: Patent/Publication/Trial
    - ID: `US2023123456A1` / `PMID: 33811245` / `NCT04567890`
    - Link: Direct URL to source
  - **Snippet:** Key excerpt from source with highlighting.
  - **Confidence Score:** 0-100% with color coding (Green: >80%, Yellow: 50-80%, Red: <50%).
  - **Verification Hash:** `SHA-256: a1b2...c3d4` with copy button.
  - **Extraction Timestamp:** `2025-10-26 14:30:22 UTC`
- **Evidence Chain View:** Mini-graph showing how this claim connects to other entities.

### **e. Report/Memo Builder**
- **Live-Preview Panel** with three views:
  1. **Executive Summary:** Auto-generated narrative of findings.
  2. **Evidence Atlas:** Visual summary of graph with key clusters.
  3. **Risk Matrix:** 2x2 grid of Biological Plausibility vs. Commercial Opportunity.
- **Editable Sections:** User can modify text, add notes, highlight key points.
- **Evidence Toggles:** Checkboxes to include/exclude specific evidence categories.
- **Export Options:**
  - **Regulatory PDF:** Includes all provenance data, hashes, and audit trail.
  - **Stakeholder PPT:** Summary slides with charts.
  - **JSON Full Dump:** Complete data for internal systems.

## **4. Mockup Fidelity & Implementation**

An AI drug-repurposing copilot integrates into pharma enterprise systems via standardized RESTful APIs and event-driven architectures, pulling anonymized experimental, genomic, and assay data to suggest repurposing candidates while feeding predictions back as annotations or workflows. This setup leverages data from lab operations to accelerate hypothesis generation without disrupting core processes.[1][2][3]

## ELN Integration
The copilot connects to ELNs like Benchling via REST APIs for reading experiment entries, molecular sequences, and assay results. Event triggers include new notebook entry creation or protocol completion, using webhooks for real-time pushes. Data contracts specify JSON schemas for compound IDs, bioassay outcomes (e.g., IC50 values), and gene expression profiles, with 21 CFR Part 11 compliance via electronic signatures and immutable audit logs.[2][4][5]

## LIMS Integration
Integration with LIMS (e.g., CrelioHealth, Scispot) uses open APIs for sample tracking, inventory, and QC data pulls. Triggers activate on sample result finalization or batch completion via incoming webhooks. Contracts define structured payloads like HL7/FHIR for test results and metadata, enforcing CAP/CLIA compliance through access controls and audit trails.[6][7][8]

## Data Warehouses/Lakes
Copilot queries unified lakehouses (e.g., Delta Lake on S3) via SQL APIs or Spark connectors for historical genomic, transcriptomic, and trial data. Batch ETL pipelines trigger nightly or on-demand for ML feature stores. Contracts use Avro/Parquet schemas for de-identified datasets, with expected latency under 5 seconds for queries and throughput of 10k records/sec.[3][9]

## API Gateways and IAM
Deployment routes through gateways (e.g., AWS API Gateway) with OAuth2/JWT tokens from IAM systems like IDM365, enforcing RBAC/ABAC. Triggers include API calls validated for user roles (e.g., researcher vs. auditor). Compliance mandates SOX/FDA adherence via rate limiting and logging; zero data leakage occurs through token-bound queries, field-level encryption, and no persistent storage in copilot—results are ephemeral and audited.[10][11]

## Regulatory Systems and Audit Tools
Connections to QMS like Veeva or Argus use secure APIs for logging predictions as CAPA items or eCTD metadata. Triggers fire on repurposing suggestion generation for audit trail creation. Contracts ensure GxP-compliant XML/JSON with e-signatures; latency targets <2s for logging, throughput 1k events/min, with controls like tamper-proof hashing and segregated regulatory feeds to prevent leakage.[12][13]

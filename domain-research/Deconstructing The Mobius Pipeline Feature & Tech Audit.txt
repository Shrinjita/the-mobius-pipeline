### **1. Core AI/Agent Architecture**

**Stated Features & Components:**
- **Master Agent:** Orchestrates the workflow, decomposes queries, and collates evidence.
- **Worker Agents:** Specialized agents for specific tasks (ClinicalTrials, Patent, Literature, Compliance, Bioactivity).
- **Agentic AI Workflow:** A defined, sequential process from query to report.
- **CrewAI:** Implied framework for multi-agent coordination (mentioned in data flow).
- **Parallel Execution:** Agents work in parallel to speed up evidence gathering.
- **AI Orchestration Layer:** Manages query relationships, semantic search, and synthesis.

**User Need Addressed:**
- **Need:** Researchers spend >80% of time on non-analytic search across fragmented sources (PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, USPTO).
- **Solution:** Automates the manual, time-consuming evidence synthesis process by delegating tasks to specialized AI agents.

**Innovative Leap Over Simple PubMed Search:**
- Goes beyond keyword search by *understanding and decomposing* a complex business question (e.g., "Repurpose Metformin for Oncology") into sub-tasks (find trials, patents, MoA papers), executes them in parallel, and synthesizes the results. A PubMed search is a single, passive query; this is an active, intelligent research assistant.

### **2. Data Layer**

**Stated Features & Components:**
- **Neo4j Knowledge Graph (KG):** Stores and connects entities (molecules, diseases, trials, patents, genes).
- **FAISS Vector Store:** Enables semantic search for literature and data.
- **Source Connectors:** APIs for PubMed (open), ClinicalTrials.gov REST, USPTO bulk data.
- **Paid Feeds (Mocked):** IQVIA/Elsevier data accessed via stubs for the POC.
- **Data Ingestion Pipelines:** Built and managed by the data engineer.

**User Need Addressed:**
- **Need:** Data exists in silos—molecular data, clinical trials, and IP are not connected, leading to missed insights.
- **Solution:** Creates a unified, queryable knowledge base that links all relevant data types, enabling cross-domain discovery (e.g., connecting a patent to a clinical trial to a molecular mechanism).

**Innovative Leap Over Simple PubMed Search:**
- PubMed is a single, flat corpus of literature. Mobius integrates *multi-modal data* (literature + clinical trials + patents + bioactivity data) into a connected graph, allowing for relationship-based reasoning (e.g., "What diseases share this mechanism of action?").

### **3. Output & Governance**

**Stated Features & Components:**
- **Report Generator:** Formats final results into an investment memo for executives.
- **Provenance Model:** A structured schema `{ claim_id, source_id, URL, timestamp, hash, confidence }` attached to every output claim.
- **OPA (Open Policy Agent) Governance Layer:** Enforces data access control and export audit policies.
- **Audit-Ready Evidence:** The entire process is designed to produce outputs that can withstand regulatory scrutiny.
- **Confidence-Scored Outputs:** Each claim or piece of evidence has an associated confidence score (0-100%).

**User Need Addressed:**
- **Need:** Lack of audit trail causes regulatory delays and makes it hard to verify claims.
- **Solution:** Provides traceability for every claim back to its primary source (PMID, NCT ID, Patent #), with cryptographic hashes for integrity, building trust and speeding up regulatory review.

**Innovative Leap Over Simple PubMed Search:**
- A PubMed search result list has no built-in audit trail, confidence scoring, or regulatory compliance framework. Mobius bakes provenance and governance into the core of its output, transforming search results into *actionable, defensible business intelligence*.

### **4. Claimed Metrics & KPIs**

**Stated Metrics:**
- **Provenance Coverage:** % of claims with ≥1 primary source ID attached. **POC: 94%** (vs. 41% manual baseline).
- **Recall Gain:** Retrieved valid evidence / manual baseline. **POC: ~10x gain** (Recall: 0.74 vs. 0.07 baseline).
- **Precision@5:** **POC: 0.81**.
- **Avg Query Latency:** **POC: 92 seconds**.
- **Time Reduction:** Target: **90 days → <10 minutes**.
- **Cost Reduction:** Target: **$50k-$100k → $5k-$10k** per candidate analysis.
- **Pipeline Throughput:** Target: **0.1 → 10-20 candidates/week**.

**User Need Addressed:**
- **Need:** Decision-making is slow, expensive, and qualitative.
- **Solution:** Provides quantitative, dramatic improvements in speed, cost, and output volume, translating directly to ROI and competitive advantage.

**Innovative Leap:**
- Moves the conversation from "Did you find some papers?" to measurable business metrics: **"We increased evidence retrieval by 10x and cut analysis time by 99.9% with 94% source verifiability."**

Drug repurposing today requires months of manual evidence
collection across scattered sources — PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov,
and patent databases. Researchers lack a unified system that links
molecular, clinical, and IP data with traceable provenance.

 The
Current gaps:

Challenge:  > 80 % time spent on non-analytic search.
 No audit trail → regulatory delays.

Accelerating  Fragmented silos → missed multi-disease insights.

Drug In current pharma R&D, compiling evidence for repurposing a single
molecule averages 90 days (≈ 600 analyst hours) across PubMed,

Repurposing ClinicalTrials.gov and USPTO.
 Our goal: build a verifiable AI pipeline unifying molecular, clinical

Decisions and patent data with audit-ready provenance, reducing
hypothesis-to-summary time from 90 days → 10 minutes on a
controlled test set.

Our Edge:
Transparent,
Multi-Agent
Repurposing
Copilot Defined Metrics:

 Provenance coverage = % of claims with ≥ 1 primary ID
(PMID/NCT/Patent).
 Recall gain = retrieved valid evidence / manual baseline (n = 30
queries).

Our copilot achieves ≈ 95 % provenance coverage and ≈ 10× recall gain
on pilot data, delivering transparent, scalable, regulation-ready insight.
